          <p className="why-choose-mue__intro-paragraph">Within the crypto currency MUE is a well established and respected brand with a mature ecosystem and progress driven by a dedicated foundation team. The rate of growth since launch and the potential to continue this trend shows MUE is only heading in one direction.</p>
          <p className="why-choose-mue__intro-paragraph">Recent migration to the Quark X11 wallet allows us to reach a larger market of miners and brings added security with a likely rise in price from a more advanced hash rate. The MasterNode network manages a pool of funds which is set aside to fund the project moving forward. Proposals put before MasterNodes allows for a democratic process over future decisions unlike other currencies in the market as well as an added layer of security over transactions on top of the miners.</p>
